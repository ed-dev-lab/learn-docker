Introduction to Containerization and Docker - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-docker-handbook/#how-to-install-docker-on-linux

Containerization = encapsulate/packaging software code so it can run consistenly and uniformly on any infrastructure.
All you need to know:
  1. Node.js
  2. Express.js
  3. SQLite3
  4. Python 2 or 3
  5. C/C++ tool-chain
  
Docker is an implementation to containerize application.

1. Intro to Docker Basics

  docker ps -a // to look at all the containers that are currently running or have run in the past.
  
  A. DOCKER ARCHITECTURE
    1. Container
       package code and dependencies together that virtualize the host OS only.
    2. Image
    3. Registry
    
    Three major components:
      1. Docker Daemon >> dockerd // keeps running in the background and waits for command from clients
      2. Docker Client >> docker // cli for transporting commands issued by users
      3. REST API // bridge between daemon and client
      
    Docker uses a client-server architecture.
    
2. Docker Container Manipulation Basics

 docker syntax || docker <object> <command> <options>
  | a. object - indicate the type of Docker object that will be manipulated
  | b. command - indicate the task to be carried out by the daemon
  | c. options - parameter that can override the default behaviour of the command
     
  How to Publish a Port
  --publish <hostport>:<containerport>
  --publish 8080:80 || any req sent to port 8080 of the system will be forwarded to port 80 inside the container
  
  How to Use Detached Mode
  --detach or -d || only get the ID of the newly created container
  
  How to List Containers
  containers ls || command can be used to list out containers that are currently running
    | docker container ls
    | docker container ls --all
    
  How to Name or Rename a Container
  by default, every container has 2 identifiers
    1. CONTAINER ID - a random 64 char-long string
      docker container run --detach --publish 8888:80 --name hello-dock-container fhsinchy/hello-dock
    2. NAME - combination of 2 random words, joined with an underscore
      docker container rename <container identifier> <new name>
 
  How to Stop or Kill a Running Container
  docker container stop <container identifier> or ctrl+c
  
  How to Restart a Container
  there are two scenarios:
    1. restarting a container that has been previously stopped or killed
    2. rebooting a running container
   docker container start <container identifier> 
   
   How to Create a Container Withour Running
   1. container create || command creates a container from a given image.
   2. container start || command starts a container that has been already
    
   How to Remove Dangling Containers
   docker container rm <container identifier>
    
   How to Run a Container in Interactive Mode
   docker container run --rm -it ubuntu || -it command will land you direclty on bash inside the ubuntu container.
   \\ --it container two separe options mashed together
        | -i or --interactive > connects you to the input stream of the container, so you can send inputs to bash
        | -t or --tty > make sure that you get some good formattin and a native terminal-like experience by allocating a pseudo-tty
        
   How to Execute Command Inside a Container
   docker container run --rm busybox echo -n my-secret | base64
